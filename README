This is a backup of all the various scripts I have made over the years.

You can clone the entire repo if you wish or download a single script
by selecting the script you want and clicking the 'raw' button on the right.

If you notice any bugs or things that can be improved create an issue using
the issue button, feel free to submit code and I may apply your patches.

Enjoy.


* /Code Snippits & Requested Scripts
This folder will be used mainly for scripts that various people have
requested that I write for them, assuming they have no problem with
having the script being available I will be hosting them here for
everyone to learn from and use.
