This is a backup of all the scripts I've made or modified over the years.
They should all work, I'm slowly removing the ones that rely on 3rd party
parsers, or I'm rewriting the script to do whatever it did without the
parser.

Anyone wishing to contribute feel free to, I'm still trying to find a way
to organise the scripts so it's not just a massive clusterfuck of scripts
everywhere. If anyone has any ideas let me know.



* /Code Snippits & Requested Scripts
This folder will be used mainly for scripts that various people have
requested that I write for them, assuming they have no problem with
having the script being available I will be hosting them here for
everyone to learn from and use.
