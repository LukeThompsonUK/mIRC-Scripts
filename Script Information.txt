Scripts and their usage.
AliasInspIRCdCheck.mrc

AliasRegexChannelBan.mrc
* Syntax: /RegexBan <Regex> [dbk]
* Example: /RegexBan /away|brb|afk|\|zzz|school|work|bnc|offline/ dk
* Will check the channel for users matching the regex.
* Flag explanation:
** b - Will ban any user that is matched
** k - Will kick any user that is matched
** d - Will echo information on who is matched and what bans would have been set had you not specified d (requires b or k to work)
** The 'd' flag is the debug flag, it's used to test regexs before actually using them so you don't accidently ban wrong people.
** You can specify multiple flags (kb to kick and ban or kbd to show you who would have been kicked/banned, or just k to kick, etc, you get the idea.)

* Syntax: /Temp <Scale> <Temperature>
* Example: /Temp F 58

* Valid Scales are:
** F - Fahrenheit
