* Flag explanation:
** b - Will ban any user that is matched
** k - Will kick any user that is matched
** d - Will echo information on who is matched and what bans would have been set had you not specified d (requires b or k to work)
** The 'd' flag is the debug flag, it's used to test regexs before actually using them so you don't accidently ban wrong people.
